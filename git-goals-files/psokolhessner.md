Peter is an assistant professor of psychology in the Affect/Social/Cognitive area in the Department of Psychology at the University of Denver and the director of the [Sokol-Hessner Lab](https://www.sokolhessnerlab.com). His lab studies affect and decision-making, using perspectives and tools from economics, neuroscience, and psychology to understand how value is constructed and decisions carried out, and the roles of emotion therein. 

## :smile: Personal Fun Fact

Peter once had a bright green (![#4cbb17](https://via.placeholder.com/15/4cbb17/000000?text=+)) mohawk for roughly two weeks. It went so well, Peter's periodically shaved his head ever since. 

## :white_check_mark: Best Practices Learning Goal

I'm excited to help my lab get our big projects onto GitHub and get each member of our lab (including me!) so comfortable using it that it becomes second nature. For me, this means that I'm committing to putting every new project's code on GitHub.
